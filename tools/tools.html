                        Although still in beta, Demeplane's character builder is my absolute favorite
                        digital character sheet for Pathfinder 2e. All my players in the Age of Ashes
                        Adventure Path use it. It makes building any Pathfinder 2e character super simple,
                        and allows me as the GM to easily keep track of my player's characters.

                        Though not quite as popular as Roll20 VTT, Foundry VTT has been my favorite virtual tabletop for not only
                        Pathfinder 2e, but any map focused ttrpg (Dungeons & Dragons, Dungeon Crawl Classics, etc). The fact
                        that the software is a one-time purchase as opposed to a subscription system is a huge plus. Aside from
                        that, Foundry VTT also boasts some incredible control and map features. Visual effects, sound sets,
                        journals, and the ability to write custom scripts.

                        Dungeondraft is an absolutely incredible map making app for any fantasy rpgs. It is a bit light on
                        resources for non-fantasy settings though. It's also quite easy to export your maps to Foundry VTT when
                        you're done creating them.
                        
                        A couple of mentions need to be made about how to make the most of this
                        software. I use the Forgotten Adventure asset packs. As far as fantasy map assets go, I haven't seen
                        anything that even comes close to the quality of Forgotten Adventures.

                        The other mention is YouTuber "FakeFairyTale" who's map-work is shown in the image to the right.
                        He's got incredible tutorials and guides on YouTube for using both Dungeondraft and the Forgotten Adventure
                        asset packs.

                        This one is a bit tough for me. The Forge certainly does what it's supposed to do,
                        which is to host an instance of Foundry VTT so that online play is super simple.
                        It's something I would rather not pay for or have the asset storage limitations of,
                        but after several failed attempts to have my players connect to my own hosted Foundry server
                        it was a pretty easy choice to go with The Forge.
